Overview :

This notebook performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the UNSW-NB15 network intrusion dataset. EDA is a crucial step in any data science project because it helps us understand the dataset—its structure, distributions, and relationships—before building any machine learning models.
Steps Summary:
Data Loading: The dataset is imported from a local file.
Basic Info: We examine the shape, columns, and data types to understand the structure.
Summary Stats: We compute basic statistics to see feature distributions.
Missing Values: We check for any missing data that needs addressing.
Target Analysis: We explore the distribution of the target variable (normal vs. attack).
Feature Distributions: We visualize numerical features (histograms) and key categorical variables.
Outliers: We detect outliers using boxplots.
Feature vs Target: We analyze how features vary between normal and attack classes.
Correlation: We visualize correlations between numerical features.
This streamlined EDA helps prepare the data for further modeling by ensuring we understand its patterns, distributions, and potential issues.
